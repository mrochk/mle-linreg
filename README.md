# MLE Linear Regression
Explanation and example of how we can derive the Ordinary Least Squares formula using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (under normal distribution assumption) for choosing linear regression parameters.

I derive it from scratch, explaining and showing all the different steps.

Everything is in the [notebook](notebook.ipynb).
